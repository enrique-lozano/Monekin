### üï∞ History of Monekin

Monekin was born from the frustration of not finding any app that could meet all my personal finance needs and functionality requirements. None of the existing solutions provided the balance between simplicity, features, and usability that I was looking for.

So, I decided to create one myself. After months of development and hard work, Monekin was released on Google Play in October 2021. Shortly after, it became 100% open-source, not only to involve external developers in improving the app but also to increase user confidence and transparency. Since then, the app has continued to grow and update continuously, thanks in part to this community of users and contributors.

### üõ† Tech Stack

At the beggining the app was developed in Ionic and Angular. In 2023, in order to make our app better, we migrate the app to Flutter, which allow us to have a much more modern and faster application while maintaining compatibility with a large number of operating systems and platforms.

To store and persist your data in the app we store a SQLite database directly in your device, thanks to an opensource package called [drift](https://github.com/simolus3/drift)
