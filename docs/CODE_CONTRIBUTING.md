# Code contributions in Monekin

In this article you will find information about the steps you should take to help us with the development of code for the application.

## 1. Fork the repo

To start, fork the project. If you are new to this, don't worry! We leave you a guide below, and if you still have problems, you can contact us whenever you wish.

**[How To Fork Guide - by GitHub.com](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)**

After that you should [run your app](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin#installation) to check that everything is correct.

## 2. Configure your developer workspace

Once you have the project up and running, you should prepare to develop in Monekin. To make changes to the project and develop on it, the use of **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** as a text editor is strongly recommended. You can use any other code editor, you can even program using Word, but Visual Studio Code is the most widespread editor for Front-End development, and using it guarantees you follow the same work methods as the administrators of this project.

### Visual Studio and Recommended extensions

To increase your productivity on this project, it is strongly recommended to install the recommended extensions. To do this, when you have the project open with Visual Studio Code, you can type `@recommended` in the extensions section, and install all the ones that appear in the list.

And that's it! You're are ready to start.

## 2. Choose what to do

You can see a list of tasks to do [here](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/issues). Once you see one that suits you and is not assigned to anyone else, you can leave a comment on the task, so that other users and administrators know who is working on it.

We especially appreciate help with [issues tagged as "help-wanted"](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22), as these are tasks that we are unable to solve due to not having enough experience or knowledge to do so.

New or inexperienced developers can go for [issues tagged as "good-first-issue"](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), as these are easier to tackle and are a great way to start getting familiar with the app's code.

If the list of tasks is too small for you, or you can't find one that matches your interest, you can:

- Propose a new task by creating an issue.
- Make code improvements and pull requests without having an opened issue.
- Ask questions or suggest ideas in the forum.
- Some recurring tasks such as [adding new languages to Monekin](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/blob/main/docs/I18N_CONTRIBUTING.md), improving marketplace screenshots, or improving documentation do not usually have a related issue. These tasks are easy to perform, maybe you can start there.

## 3. Create a new working branch in your fork

Once you've decided on what you want to contribute it's time to create a new branch in your forked Monekin
repository.

    git checkout -b your-branch-name develop

> **NOTE**: You should replace `your-branch-name` with a good name to give to your branch. For example `fix/XXXX` where XXXX is the Issue number, or `feature/some-new-feature`.

This will be the branch in which you will code, make commits, etc. Before start coding it **is strongly recommended to read the [git branch workflow](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/blob/main/docs/GIT_BRANCHES_WORKFLOW.md) and the [commit message convention](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/blob/main/docs/COMMIT_MSG.md) that we use in this project**.

`main` and `develop` branches are protected and only administrators can upload changes to them directly. All other users will have to make a Pull Request (step 4).

## 4. Time to work

With your branch created, it’s time to start coding! Follow these steps and tips to ensure your contributions are high-quality and effective:

### Workflow

1. **Write and Commit Code**: Implement your solution and make meaningful commits that comply with what was established in the previous section.
2. **Refactor Your Code**: Simplify and optimize your implementation. Remember:
   - "Don't walk away from complexity, run!"
   - Aim for the simplest, most efficient solution.
3. **Test Frequently**: Verify your changes don’t break existing functionality. Build the app often and check that your implementation works as expected.
4. **Regenerate Code (if required)**: Some tasks, like modifying enums or translations, require regenerating files to reflect the updates:
   - For general code generation:
     ```bash
     dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
     ```
   - For translation updates only you can run this command, which is faster:
     ```bash
     dart run slang
     ```

### Tips

- **Keep It Simple**: Ask yourself:
  - Is this the simplest solution?
  - Can it be done with less code and fewer changes?
  - Does it handle all cases?
- **Minimize Breakage**: Ensure your changes don’t disrupt existing features in any OS.

By following these steps and tips, you’ll maintain code quality and contribute effectively to Monekin.

## 5. Submit a PR to `develop` branch

So far you should have pushed your work to your working branch and have tested that it works on all the compatible devices. Then final step is to open a pull request to the `develop` branch of the official [Monekin repo](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin).

**[How To Submit a PR Guide - by GitHub.com](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that the `develop` branch is chosen as "base" in the PR. Pull requests to `main` will be changed to the `develop` branch, or in the worst case, rejected.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project doesn't have QA, so you are the QA! Please test your implementation carefully.
