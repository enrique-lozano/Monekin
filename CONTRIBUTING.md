# Contributing to Monekin

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Monekin. It's people like you that make this application such a great tool.

In this article you will find information about the steps you should take to help us with the development of code for the application. Note that it also helps to [report bugs](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/issues), participate in the [forum](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/discussions) and in short, be active in our community!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Reporting issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in Monekin? If so, we will be very grateful to hear from you to solve it as soon as possible.

Before reporting an issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed. If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* 👍 - upvote
* 👎 - downvote

To report an issue, go to the [open issues page](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/issues) and create a new issue clicking the green bottom at the right-top of the section. We provide a template to fill the required data that we need to solve the issue. Try to be as detailed as possible in your explanations and descriptions. Attach screenshots or videos if necessary.

## Asking questions

Have a question? Rather than opening an issue, please go to the [Monekin Forum](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/discussions/categories/q-a). The active community will be eager to assist you. Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

## Feature request

As with questions, for feature requests and suggestions we encourage you to use the [forum](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/discussions/categories/ideas). If your request/suggestion is well-accepted, we will create an issue with it to take it into account for future releases.

If your suggestion has already been made by someone else, please instead of creating a new thread, react or reply to this one. Suggestions with more interactions/upvotes will have a better chance of being selected.

## Create something new / Fix a bug

If you are interested in writing code to fix issues or to create new features please refer to this [guide](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/blob/main/docs/CODE_CONTRIBUTING.md).
