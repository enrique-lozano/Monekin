First off, thank you for considering contributing to Monekin. It's people like you that make this application such a great tool. There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

Before you continue reading, we recommend you review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Here we introduce the rules that every contributor must follow to ensure a welcoming and productive community for everyone.

## Report issues and request features

Have you encountered a bug or thought of a way to improve Monekin? If so, we will be very grateful to hear from you to solve it as soon as possible. Both bugs and feature ideas can be submitted through GitHub Issues, but we ask you to follow a few guidelines to ensure smooth collaboration:

### Before Submitting

Before filing an issue or feature request, please take a moment to check if your topic has already been raised. Start by searching through the [open issues](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/discussions) to see if the bug or feature idea has already been reported.

If you find an existing issue or discussion that matches yours, please upvote it by adding a 👍 reaction to the top post. This helps us prioritize issues and feature requests based on community interest. If you have additional relevant details or context to add, feel free to leave a comment, but avoid comments like `"+1"` or `"I have this issue too"`. Use reactions instead to express your support and **keep the discussion clean**.

We prioritize issues and feature requests based on community interest and relevance to the app’s goals. Items with more reactions, thoughtful comments, and active engagement will be considered first, so make sure to show your support for ideas you find important!

### Submitting the issue / feature request

If your bug or feature idea hasn’t been reported yet you can go ahead and submit it by yourself:

1. Go to the [issues page](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/issues) and click the green button at the top-right of the page.
2. Select the appropriate template (e.g., bug report or feature request).
3. Provide as much detail as possible

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your feature idea isn’t fully developed or lacks clear requirements, [post your idea/request in the Monekin Forum](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/discussions/new?category=ideas-new-features). The mantainers and the community of Monekin will help you giving shape to your idea. Once it gains clarity and support, it can be formalized into an issue to be developed.

### Guidelines for Submitting Issues and Requests

1. File **one issue per problem or feature request**. Do not combine multiple bugs or requests in the same issue.
2. Avoid posting your issue as a comment on an unrelated or resolved issue. Many issues may appear similar but have different causes.
3. **Be polite.** If your request sounds like an order, you’re doing it wrong.

> **Note:** Failure to follow these guidelines may result in your issue or request being closed or deleted.

## Use the forum

The [Monekin Forum](https://github.com/enrique-lozano/Monekin/discussions) is where the community comes together to share ideas, ask questions, and collaborate. Use the forum to:

- **Ask Questions**: Seek help or clarification
- **Help Others**: Assist fellow users by answering their questions and sharing your expertise.
- **Share Your Ideas**: Discuss potential features or improvements in a more informal way.
- **Showcase Your Work**: Share tips or examples of how Monekin has helped you.

Your participation in the forum inspires the team and the community. Whether it’s sharing feedback, showcasing your work, or brainstorming ideas, your voice matters!
